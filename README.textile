h1. Chat Engine

Chat Engine is a lightweight rails engine that heavily uses jQuery and memcached to implement a very simple group chat room.

h2. Status

Chat Engine has just been ported to rails 2.3, and its original design striped.

h2. Features

* You must enter a nickname to be part of the chat room.
* All logged in users are shown in the user list
* Lines in the chat that mention a users nickname are highlighted.
* Inactivity timer will logout users from the client side.
* rake task to logout users whose browsers do not allow ajax requests in the unload event.
* The ability to mute specific users (from script/console). Muted users will see their own messages, but no one else will.

h2. Usage

install chat-engine
  <pre><code>
  	./script/plugin install git://github.com/amiel/chat-engine.git
  </code></pre>
copy assets
  <pre><code>
  	rake chat:sync
  </code></pre>
include assets, don't forget jquery
  <pre><code>
  	<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'chat' %>
  	<%= javascript_include_tag 'jquery-x.x.x.js', 'auto_scroll', 'chat' %>
  </code></pre>
use the chat_overlay partial
  <pre><code>
  	<%= render :partial => 'chats/chat_overlay' %>
  </code></pre>
thats it! it will work with memory_store, but is not persistent across mongrels. User mem_cached_store for best results.
